> Boom Bikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19. They have planned this to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs once the situation gets better all around and stand out from other service providers and make huge profits.

## General Information
- Business problem - The company wants to know:
Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes. How well those variables describe the bike demands Based on various meteorological surveys and people's styles, the service provider firm has gathered a large dataset on daily bike demands across the American market based on some factors.

- The dataset used is day.csv


## Conclusions
- A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes can focus more on Temperature
- Demand for bikes was more in 2019 than 2018, so just focus as there is increase in 2019 and might be facing dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic and      by the time it reduces the things will be better.

-Weathersit variable, we have got negative coefficients for Mist +cloudy and Lightsnow weather... And yes we can give offers- Conclusion 4 from the analysis
